# TschutTschut

This is an animated ASCI-train, that can cross multiple windows and even computers. You can add your own animated ASCI-animations and let them run accros browsers.
This project was build because it was a spontaneos idea, it is fun and to test WebRTC as peer to peer technology without the need of a central server. It basically works, but besides missing features, WebRTC may fail to work under specific network conditions.

## Demo
(this screencast is laggy due to compression, it will be a fluent animation if you try it yourself)
![Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enrico-kaack/TschutTschut/master/train.gif)

## Instructions
1. The first user opens https://enrico-kaack.github.io/TschutTschut/ and choose "Become Master"
2. This user copys the url and gives it to the one on the left (the train will run from the right side of a screen to the left side of a screen and will then jump to the next in line)
3. Repeat this, until all browsers are opened. Then the first user clicks "Connect all peers" to create the train tracks.
4. Now, everyone is connected and the trains can start rolling!
5. Don't forget to make the TschutTschut sound when launching a train!

The train ASCI is originaly by Joan Stark (https://www.asciiart.eu/vehicles/trains). It was modified to a keyframe animation by me.
